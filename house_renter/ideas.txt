I have a few houses for rent.

I want a web app that works on mobile that lets me manage them:
when is each house rented, who rented it, how much they paid, where did the rent come from 
(personal, booking, airbnb), for booking, etc, it should show the commision too.

I also want to log expenses, cleaning, services, etc.

I should be able to quickly see what house is free, for how long and what house is occuupied and for how long.

The interface should prioritize occupancy status over any other detail since i will use it on the move, but i should be able to 
log detailed things too.
